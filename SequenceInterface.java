/**  SequenceInterface<T> interface for CS 0445 Assignment 2
 * @author Sherif Khattab
 * @param <T> The data type of the items stored in the sequence.
 *
 * Carefully read the specifications for each of the operations and
 * Please make sure to implement them correctly in your LinkedDS class.
 *
 * A Sequence stores an unlimited number of items in a certain logical order. The head of the Sequence is 
 * its first item and the Sequence's tail is its last item. Items can only be added 
 * to the beginning (using the prefix operation) or to the end (using the tail operation) of 
 * the Sequence. The items in a Sequence are not necessarily unique. Don't worry as much about efficiency here as you do
 * about correctness. Items in the Sequence are comparable to each other.
